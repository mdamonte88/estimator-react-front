        Bludcode Roadmapping is a process where we dive deep into the concept for your product,
          design a solution that solves the core problem while staying lean, and prepare you with everything
          you need to develop your product the right way. At the end of a Roadmapping session,
          youâ€™ll come out with a clickable prototype, a step-by-step blueprint for development,
          and the knowledge that your product is ready for its users.
